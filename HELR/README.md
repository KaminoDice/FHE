Secure Logistic Regression based on Homomorphic Encryption
Our code requires the NTL library which is available at http://www.shoup.net/ntl/, and a c++ compiler. Our underlying homomorphic encryption scheme is “Homomorphic Encryption for Arithmetic of Approximate Numbers” and we referred to its library in the "src" folder.
$make clean
$make all
This will build our library “libHELR.a”. Then the following should work:
$g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -I/usr/local/include -pthread main.cpp libHELR.a -o foo -L/usr/local/lib -lntl -lgmp -lm
for compiling the code and making your program main.cpp The program will run with a filename and a degree of approximating polynomial of the sigmoid function. For example, you can write:
$./foo data/edint.txt 3
In particular, our program supports the evaluation of the gradient descent algorithm based on polynomial of degree 3 or degree 7 with several optimizations.
